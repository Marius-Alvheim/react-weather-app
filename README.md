This weather app is built using https://www.weatherapi.com/ and its free tier. 
I am only able to get the forecast for the first three days on the free tier.

To use you need to give the app permission to your location, it gets the users longitude and latitude to fetch the weather data from the api where the user is currently.

This app is only styled for phones right now since im taking a mobile first approach, it's not styled for tablets or desktops yet and need some work for small phones.
